What do you want for UI

Uhh...

I want a tree where each element represents an a step in an order of operations used to generate the game world

```
define mapsize
define seed points
define quad tree
define voronoi
define external heightmap
define biomes
define regional biomes
define hillsides
define doodads
```

* 2 hoziontal boxes. 
* On the left-hand side you have a list of all the operations you can perform. 
* On the right you have a list of all the operations being performed in the order they're listed. 
* You can drag and drop to re-organise the elements of the list in the right. 
* While an element is selected on the left you can click a button to move it to the right box

  Yeah we might not want to do that, too time consuming. Just make it a one-and-done tool. It can still show the map as a preview but setting up tools for re-arranging the order of operations won't be worth it.

  Okay, so, just a button that says "generate" that populates a database?

  I'm sure we can do better than that, surely. MMMMMM...

  Well, it's a tool, it's meant to be general-use tool, not for a singular purpose.

  If you wanna make a game, make a game. But don't tie it into this thing, y'know?
